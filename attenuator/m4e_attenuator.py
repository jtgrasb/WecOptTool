 Bodies data: defining the joint and body configuration
 data.Joints:              List where each element represents a joint [Parent, Child]
 data.Type:                List specifying joint types ('F' for floating, 'R' for revolute, 'P' for prismatic)
 data.ParentCGtoJoint:     List containing vectors from parent CG to joint location
 data.JointtoChildCG:      List containing vectors from joint to child CG
 data.prismatic_direction: Unit vectors for prismatic joints, use [nan,nan] if NO prismatic joint

 Points data: dictionary
 You can use the variables in PointNames to define points location, Ex: PointNames = ["b1"]
 Initial points of the system, categorized by grounded points (GR) and body points (BD)
 DEFINE THESE EMPTY IF NO POINTS ARE REQUIRED, Ex: Initial_Points['GR'] = []
 Initial_Points["GR"] = [[20, 0], [b1, 0]]
 Initial_Points["BD"] is a DICTIONARY where each entry is the body number they belong to
 Initial_Points["BD"][i], 'i', is the body and the rest is defined as 'GR' points

 Forces definition: dictionary
 You can use the variables in ForceNames to define points location, Ex: ForceNames = ["f1"]
 DEFINE ALL FIELDS, if empty use: Force['PointsBD ']= []
 Force.PointsBD       = list of lists: [[Initial_points.BD(i),Initial_points.BD(j),Fx,Fy,Mz]]
 Force.CG             = list of lists: [[Initial_points.BD(i),Initial_points.BD(j),Fx,Fy,Mz]]
 Force.TensionSpring  = list of tuples: [(('Point1','Point2'),[L_0,k])]
 Force.TensionDamper  = list of tuples: [(('Point1','Point2'),C_0)]
 Force.TorsionSpring  = list of tuples: [(('Body1','Body2'),[theta_0,k])]
 Force.TorsionDamper  = list of tuples: [(('Body1','Body2'),C_0)]
 LEGEND:
 Fx,Fy,Mz : force components
 L_0:       spring undeformed length
 k:         spring constant 
 C_0:       damping coefficient

 Numerical inputs for simulation
 m0:        column vector with the mass of each body    
 J0:        column vector with the inertia of each body
 gVec:      column vector of 0s and 1s, with 0 indicating if a body is not
            subject to gravity (let's say it's floating)
